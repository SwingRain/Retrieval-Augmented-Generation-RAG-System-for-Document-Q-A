# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLaMA-3, LangChain, and ChromaDB

This repository contains code and resources for implementing a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system using the LLaMA-3 model. The project utilizes LangChain to manage language model chains and ChromaDB as the vector database for document retrieval. The goal is to enhance text generation by retrieving relevant information and incorporating it into the generation process.

## Project Overview

In this project, we:
- Leverage **LLaMA-3** for generation tasks, fine-tuning it for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance text generation with relevant context.
- Use **LangChain** to manage and orchestrate language model chains, handling the flow between retrieval and generation components.
- Implement **ChromaDB** as the vector store for fast and efficient document retrieval, ensuring that the generated content is contextually relevant and informative.

## Key Results

The RAG system has shown to improve the quality of generated responses by integrating retrieved information, making it useful for applications such as:
- Question Answering
- Conversational AI
- Content Generation
