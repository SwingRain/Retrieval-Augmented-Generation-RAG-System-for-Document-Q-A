        "\n",
        "Large Language Models (LLMs) has proven their ability to understand context and provide accurate answers to various NLP tasks, including summarization, Q&A, when prompted. While being able to provide very good answers to questions about information that they were trained with, they tend to hallucinate when the topic is about information that they do \"not know\", i.e. was not included in their training data. Retrieval Augmented Generation combines external resources with LLMs. The main two components of a RAG are therefore a retriever and a generator.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The retriever part can be described as a system that is able to encode our data so that can be easily retrieved the relevant parts of it upon queriying it. The encoding is done using text embeddings, i.e. a model trained to create a vector representation of the information. The best option for implementing a retriever is a vector database. As vector database, there are multiple options, both open source or commercial products. Few examples are ChromaDB, Mevius, FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate. Our option in this Notebook will be a local instance of ChromaDB (persistent).\n",
        "\n",
        "For the generator part, the obvious option is a LLM. In this Notebook we will use a quantized Llama3 model, from the Kaggle Models collection.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The orchestration of the retriever and generator will be done using Langchain. A specialized function from Langchain allows us to create the receiver-generator in one line of code.\n"

              "Regarding the challenges, I think one of the biggest hurdles the EU AI Act will face is the need for a clear and consistent definition of AI. The regulation will need to define what constitutes AI, and how it will be regulated, to ensure that it is applied consistently across the EU. Additionally, there may be challenges in implementing the regulation, particularly in industries that are heavily reliant on AI, such as healthcare and finance.\n",

              "Another challenge will be ensuring that the regulation is enforced effectively, particularly in cases where AI is used in high-risk applications.

By promoting the development of AI that is fair and unbiased, the regulation can help to ensure that AI is used in a way that benefits society as a whole, rather than exacerbating existing social and economic inequalities.\n",
